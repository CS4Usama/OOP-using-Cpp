		input 4 as choice, Statement Terminator terminates the whole statement
		and exits from program as per our program requirement.
		Actually, this is a trick (When I want to execute only else-if statement
		without using any statement inside it. Statement Terminator is used).
		However, this trick is against our Syntax Rule.
		I have used this trick as an alternate to break statement.
		Because break statement is only used with loops and switch statements,
		it cannot be used with if-else statements.*/
